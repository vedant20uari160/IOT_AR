#USECASE  
You could use it for educational purposes, like explaining space concepts in an engaging way. Or perhaps create an AR experience by adding a realistic background for entertainment, allowing users to explore a virtual space environment.   
#LIMITATION  
Users unfamiliar with AR technology might face a learning curve, impacting the initial ease of use and understanding.  
Users may require a sufficient physical space to fully engage with the AR environment, potentially restricting the project's usability in constrained settings.  
While the project strives for realism, certain limitations in current AR technology may affect the absolute accuracy of physics simulations and visual fidelity.
